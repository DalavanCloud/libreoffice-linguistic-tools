In the ECDriver project, there is something called %(callingConvention) set to cdecl.  I don't see anything that looks like _stdcall is set.

The following also seem to be set:
_UNICODE
UNICODE
WIN32
_WINDOWS
_WINDLL
_DEBUG
ECDRIVER_EXPORTS

I still can't imagine why the C++ code seems to work from OpenOffice but not my simplified recompiled code run from the command line.
What about trying the OpenOffice component-testing code?  I'm not sure if it's already compiled or not.
