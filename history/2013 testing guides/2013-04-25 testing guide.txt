Try to cover all of the different features to see if any of the code gets
rejected on Python 3. So primarily test by feature breadth rather than depth.
(Depth meaning trying to break a particular feature).

Phonology
    Toolbox, LIFT, paxml
    inserting, updating, replacing
    change writing system
Grammar
    Toolbox, flextext
    inserting, replacing
    updating and buttons with/without saving
    with/without orth, text, mb, outer table
    frames, tables
    different prefixes
Abbreviations
    scan, insert list
    change and delete items in list
    change all caps
    search
Data Conversion
    scope whole doc, selection, by complex font, para style, char style 
    no converter, initialize converter, autoselect converter
    change font, change para style, change char style
    create new para style, create new char style
    SFM worked this time.
Word list
    writer: grab by whole doc, para style, char style, font
    flextext, lift, sfm, toolbox interlin, toolbox phonetic
    Paratext Spelling Status XML
    change lift writing system and see difference
    do not split by spaces
    changed punctuation
    changed column order, found by apply converter
    apply converter filled in dest column completely
Spelling
    compare spelling - get at least one result
    step through list: set correction
    save change file: xslt, cct
    !!! Glitch: <xsl:template match="&55.DlgChangerMaker.txtXpath.Value">
        When field was left unchanged.
Make spelling changes
    corrections, good list
    !!! Choked: Changing whole doc started an infinite loop.
        Probably happened when making changes to text in frames.
    !!! Problem: On Win 8, the interaction between Calc and Writer windows
        seems awkward. Adding progress bars may help.
    search by language, para style, char style, font
    changed punctuation (and saw difference)
    affixes seemed to work
    case sensitivity works but may not be obvious, although it is documented.
Script Practice
    get list from toolbox interlinear gloss
    !!! Improvement: Grey out Spreadsheet Column Order when getting words.
Spanish
    made sure dialogs open and look ok
    tested l10zed btn title "Get words" when getting words for Script Pract
French
    made sure dialogs open and look ok
Unit tests
    !!! Bug: SpellingChecks_test.testAffixesEN seems to be choking
        in the infinite loop mentioned earlier.
        It might be a problem of window management.
        Occurring at: Traveler.py 132 - 0, 0 up (repeated infinitely)
        Problem is Python 3 division operator is different.
    All other tests except SpellingChecks_test pass.
    And SpellingChecks_test passes if run by itself.
Button tests
    got Data Conversion test to work
        add to App/DataConversion.py.getFormResults_fromUserVars():
        config.targetStyle = ""
        config.askEach = False
        config.scopeFontType = self.userVars.get("ScopeFontType")
    however it is really not very helpful, since it is hard to verify
    so get rid of it once unit tests can cover those cases
    take all button tests out of the 2.0.oxt immediately
    - move to testing folder

    Toolbox, flextext
    inserting, replacing
    updating and buttons with/without saving
    with/without orth, text, mb, outer table
    frames, tables
    no prefixes but two different documents
Abbreviations
    scan, insert list
    change and delete items in list
    change all caps
    search
Data Conversion
    scope whole doc, selection, para style, char style, sfm
    scope standard versus complex font (saw the difference)
    no converter, initialize converter, autoselect converter
    change font, change para style, change char style
    create new para style, create new char style

    writer: grab by whole doc, para style, char style, font

Spelling
    compare spelling - get at least one result
    step through list: set correction
    !!! Choked: When pressing Set Correction button in Telegu list.
    save change file: xslt, cct
    !!! Bug: Full CC table ignores final \sf marker in list.
Make spelling changes
    corrections, good list
    did not choke when changing whole doc, so perhaps that was a Py3 problem.
    search by lang, para style
Script Practice
    get list from current writer document
French
    !!! "Match partial text" in DlgChangeMaker is in English. (both Fr & Es)
Spanish
    made sure dialogs open and look ok
Unit tests
    !!! Test failed:
        DlgDataConv_test.py", line 139, in test_target3
        self.assertEqual(self.dlg.config.targetFontName, "Mangal")
        AssertionError: None != 'Mangal'
        Cause is the style name is "Default" instead of "Default Style".
    Rest of test suite passed, including spelling (unlike for LO).
