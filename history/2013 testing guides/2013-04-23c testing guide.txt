Phonology
    !!! Improvement: Perhaps don't need to auto uncheck "Search from beginning"
        when updating.
        Although it kind of makes sense how it works now.

    !!! Limitation: Word list headings are in English.
French
    !!! Glitch: In Script Practice dialog, "E" of "Ecriture" is partly cut off.
    !!! Glitch: In Script Practice title, after going to practice and back
        again, "e" is shown as block question mark.
    !!! Glitch: In Spelling Search, "les style" is cut off at the end.
    !!! Problem: "Made 0 corrections" was in English.

Automated Tests
    !!! Improvement: In DlgDataConv, it would be nice if changing target from
        Standard to Complex would re-grab the default.
        However this might be bad in some cases.
    Ran suite: 25 tests passed.
Button driven Tests
    !!! Crash: Data Conversion test will not work on Linux due to Initialize
        problem.
    Phonology button test seemed ok.
    Grammar button test can be run minimized.
    Grammar button test seemed ok.

Try to cover all of the different features to see if any of the code gets
rejected on Python 3. So primarily test by feature breadth rather than depth.
(Depth meaning trying to break a particular feature).

Phonology
    Toolbox, LIFT, paxml
    inserting, updating, replacing
    change writing system
Grammar
    Toolbox, flextext
    inserting, replacing
    updating and buttons with/without saving
    with/without orth, text, mb, outer table
    frames, tables
    different prefixes
Abbreviations
    scan, insert list
    change and delete items in list
    change all caps
    search
Data Conversion
    scope whole doc, selection, by complex font, para style, char style, 
    no converter, initialize converter, autoselect converter
    change font, change para style
    create new para style
    ask
    !!! Glitch: Reversing CC ToUpper did not work, apparently because it is a
        one-way converter.  SEC complained about it being a unicode problem.
        This is not an OOoLT issue.
    !!! Problem: When the converter failed, the selected text had been deleted
        and the new text had not been added yet, with a net loss of data.
        Undo was able to retrieve the lost data.
    !!! Choked: When converting SFM markers.
        Module object has no attribute 'join':
        sfm_expr = string.join(sfms, r'|')
    !!! Choked: When creating new char style.
        Cannot figure out how to reproduce this error.
        Perhaps not caused by creating new char style (maybe SFM bug).
Word list
    writer: grab by whole doc, para style, char style, font
    flextext, lift, sfm, toolbox interlin
    Paratext Spelling Status XML also shows correction and IsCorrect marks.
    change lift writing system and see difference
    do not split by spaces
    changed punctuation
    changed column order, found by apply converter
    !!! Bug: No columns available in Field / Part for spreadsheets.
    !!! Choked: For spreadsheet with no settings, when trying to open dialog to
        modify settings.
        DlgWordListFile showDlg got past "Got controls" and that is all.
    !!! Bug: Field / Part not activated for spreadsheets.
Spelling
    compare spelling found lots of results for Telegu list
    !!! Problem: Changed column to Gautami font for Telegu. However in Step
        through List, still shows up as boxes.
    !!! Problem: Browse... did not add .xsl, so filename is just "1".
Make spelling changes
    Tested simple replacement CC table with Data Conversion.
    Windows does not have a built-in XSLT processor, but Saxon is recommended
    because it supports XSLT 2.0.
    !!! Choked: Make Spelling Changes dialog failed to open.
        dict_items object has no attribute 'sort':
        self.localeList.sort(key=lambda tupl: tupl[1]) # sort by lang name
Script Practice
    get list from flextext
    TODO: test localized button title "Get words" when getting word list
Spanish
    tested all dialogs (but Make Spelling Changes failed as above)
French
    Script Practice dialog title looks fine.
    However the Ecriture label is still cut off.
Unit tests
    !!! Python 3 error
        Traveler.py line 169 in cursorGo: parts.extend([MAX_SIZE] * div)
        TypeError: cannot multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'
