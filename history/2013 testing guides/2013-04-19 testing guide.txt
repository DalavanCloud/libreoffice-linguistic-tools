Phonology
    Lift
    !!! Bug: Never applying Lex Example para style.
    Can select "seh" writing system now.
    JPDN37.6, JPDN38.7, JPDN38.8
    JGDN02.3, JGDN02.4
    0001, 0002
Grammar
    Numbering width error messages are better now.
    Updating examples.
    Message about outer table only complains once now.
    !!! Bug: Updated a lot of examples but then at the end said did not
        find any existing examples to update.
        (Probably last one failed, but the error message doesn't make sense).
    !!! Bug: see "updating problem.odt"
        Leaves "then" and in comparison doc, says there was a problem.
        (Otherwise looks ok).
    !!! Bug: When updating examples, cannot find existing ref number (not #refn)
        to update if it is located on the next line after a table containing
        a ref number.
        (Apparently it's not considered as a separate line).
    Spacing seems better now.
Abbreviations
    Scan
    Search
Data Conversion
    Can convert by Default Para style now.
Word list
    Apply Converters finds all rows now, and the right columns.
    Handles errors from bad SFM files better now.
Spelling
    IsCorrect checkbox is working better now.
    !!! Improvement: Filename extension should change if radio buttons are
        changed (replace "xsl" with "cct" in filename text box).
    !!! Bug: CCT datestamp is still wrong (but XSLT is fixed).
    !!! Choked: "Untitled 3.ods" Step through list with "updating problem.odt"
        opened (it wasn't used to generate that list).

    Test simple CC table again.         # may be easier on Windows
    Run full CC table on an SFM file.   # may be easier on Windows
    TODO: Find a built-in XSLT 1.0 processor on windows if possible.
Make spelling changes
    !!! Bug: Change Spelling choked on "greens" (or perhaps just stopped).
        Using Whole Document search. Same problem with searching by style.
        Word gets highlighted all but rightmost char, then stops.
        Chokes before asking for confirmation.
        Spellchecking by good list asks about part of the first word, then
        stops (after only one word).

    Now correctly ignores changes where from and to are the same.
Script Practice
    !!! Bug: Set number of words to "0". Seemed to use 1, but didn't change
        value in text box.
