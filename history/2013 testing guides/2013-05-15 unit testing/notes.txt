On Fedora some tests don't pass because fonts are not installed.
- Times New Roman (uses Liberation Serif instead)
- Arial Black (Cantarell works instead)
- DejaVu Sans is the default complex font, although Lohit Hindi is installed.
DlgDataConv_test especially depended on this.

Windows Vista OOo and Win8 AO have python 2.6,
which means unittest is significantly less powerful.
- setUpClass
- assertRegex
- assertNotIn

Several systems had "Default" instead of "Default Style".
These tests should pass now.

Several tests had repeatability problems that have been fixed now.
Notable among these was TablesTest.

For every system and app, without exception the tests did not pass at first.
- paths (all systems)
- install latest extension (and OOo / AO required restarting)
- enable complex languages
- permissions (Fedora)

None of these tests found any actual errors in OOoLT today.
There were only errors found in the tests and testing setup.
