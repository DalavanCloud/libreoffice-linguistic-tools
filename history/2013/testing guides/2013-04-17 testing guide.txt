Phonology
    Lift
    Find and Replace
    !!! Bug: After inserting an example, char style is still Lex Ref Number.
    !!! Bug: After replacing example, following example has tabs messed up.
        Same thing occurs if an example is inserted with the cursor at the
        beginning of a line containing an example.
    !!! Choked: DlgWritingSystem didn't close when selecting Sena (seh).
        When Sena (x-etic) is selected, "seh" is erroneously obtained.
    Were these problems in 1.9.9.5b and we just didn't notice during testing,
    or were they introduced in 1.9.9.6b somehow?
    !!! Improvement: When no writing systems are found, writing system selection
        still appears and just gives option "(none)", rather than displaying
        an error message.
    JPDN37.6, JPDN38.7, JPDN38.8
    JGDN02.3, JGDN02.4
    0001, 0002
    Tested JPG files.
Grammar
    Numbering width.
    Updating examples.
    !!! Improvement: Error message says "Column width is not a number" but then
        dialog closes anyway, so there's not a good chance to fix it.
        It resets the value, which makes sense, but still it seems confusing.
    !!! Bug: Vattalaki was set to ref number char style instead of JPDN.
        With all settings set to opposite of default.
        Unsetting free translation in quotes has something to do with it.
        Making an outer table makes it work.
    !!! Bug: Replacing deletes the next character.
        Occurs using tables (not frames) with no outer table.
    !!! Improvement: Keeps saying "Found a ref number, but needs outer table."
        Once is enough; then just keep going.
        Actually, we're in an infinite loop (see next bug).
    !!! Bug: Find Next for updating gets stuck on the first one if it's not
        at the end of a line.
        It keeps searching from the beginning, even when Search from
        beginning isn't checked, and then it stops at the same place.
    Buttons from comparison doc seem to be working good enough now.
    !!! Problem: Spacing again: An example with just one frame shows a big
        space above the free translation.
        It disappears if you type something after the frame.
Abbreviations
    Change labels
    Scan
    Search
    Change caps
Data Conversion
    Caption Characters works.
    !!! Limitation: Cannot convert by Default Para or Char style.
Word list
    !!! Bug: Apply Converter missed final row.
    Default columns for Apply Converter are working now.
    !!! Choked: When getting words from SFM file.
        \ps \ge, \tx
        Still doesn't work in 1.9.9.6b
    Tested word list by font.
    !!! Problem: Words will be counted twice if they match more than one
        search criteria, for example Arial Bold font and Strong Emphasis style.
Spelling
    !!! Bug: Says "No data found" unless data is in row 3 or higher.
        Can only navigate to maxRow - 1.

    If a word is incorrect, it won't show up in suggestions, nor will the
    correction if available. That might be best in some situations, though,
    because the correction might be a phrase rather than a word. It might
    be just a fix for that occurrence, not a regular word.

    !!! Choked: Step Through List on "word list Irula Mark.ods"
        when a writer document with non-matching settings was opened.
        Perhaps initial row num problem?

    Highlighting erroneous row numbers works conveniently now.

    One solution to the small font problem would be to allow font name and
    size to be changed somehow, either hidden user var or drop-down box.


    !!! Bug: Can't tell by looking at checkbox whether row has an "X" in the
        Correct? column or not.
    !!! Bug: Cannot change Correct? button unless correction value is different.
    !!! Bug: Cannot clear Correction column for a row.

    Set Correction button greying is working better now.

    !!! Limitation: Quotes in XPath expressions are not escaped.

    !!! Bug: Date stamp shows year first instead of last.

    Tested XSLT file with and without matching partial strings.

    Test simple CC table again.         # may be easier on Windows
    Run full CC table on an SFM file.   # may be easier on Windows
    TODO: Find a built-in XSLT 1.0 processor on windows if possible.
Make spelling changes
    !!! Limitation: Cannot search by complex language.
    !!! Problem: If Word and Correction are the same, keeps changing.
        Should just ignore it.

    Making corrections by font and para style seemed to work.
    Complex and asian fonts seemed to work.

    !!! Bug: In spell checking, does not find last word in good list.
        (Probably related to maxRow - 1 bug mentioned earlier).
    !!! Improvement: Spell checking dialog font is small for Tamil.

    New hyphen behavior seems better.
Script Practice
    !!! Documentation: Mention that word won't be checked until what you
        typed is long enough.
