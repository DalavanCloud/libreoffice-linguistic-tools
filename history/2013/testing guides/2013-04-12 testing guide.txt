Phonology
    Lift
    !!! Glitch: "Sena" appears twice when choosing writing system for new
        fieldworks data.
        There are actually two different writing systems represented,
        so this is apparently not a glitch. One solution would be to display
        (sena-x-etic) after "Sena" in the dialog window.
    Find and Replace
    JGDN02.3, JGDN02.4
    JGDN02.5, JGDN03.5  # not found
    0001, 0002
    Tested JPG files.
    Note: As we make changes to fix 1.9.9.5b grammar errors, realize that
    phonology is pretty much working correctly now, so try not to mess it up.
Grammar
    Numbering width.
    Updating examples.
    !!! Bug: When inserting grammar examples without an outer table,
        free translation in second example uses ref number char style.
        (Free trans doesn't have a char style of its own, just a para style).
        Decision: Fix.
    !!! Bug:  When replacing grammar examples without an outer table,
        it deletes the next character (for example #).
        This also occurs when inserting two consecutive examples.
        (Free trans doesn't get messed up until there's nothing left to delete
        afterwards).
    The above two problems do not occur with outer tables.
    !!! Glitch: When updating examples using tables, without outer tables,
        the screen flashes
        strangely as it traverses through looking for the char style.
        It makes it pretty slow.
        Could it be moving the viewcursor from the beginning of the document?
    !!! Bug: When the main document is named Untitled 1, the comparison doc
        will also be untitled 1, and then the comparison buttons don't go
        back to the main document.
    !!! Bug: If mainDoc is None Then:
        Doesn't seem to work, because mainDoc.getController resulted in error
        Object not set.
    It is correctly opening just one comparison doc.
    Tested prefixes.
    Tested large example: fromSelvi-all.xml COCO.001
    Tested all lines.
    Spacing problems seem to be fixed now.
    Large examples seem to be reasonably fast on this system.
Abbreviations
    Search no longer finds blank strings.
    Search
Data Conversion
    Any to latin in tables and frames works.
    !!! Crash: Data conversion typed in "capsTest", converted, then reverse
        direction, crashed the second time.
Word list
    !!! Bug: Apply Converter defaults to empty for columns.
    Make a list from lots of different files
    Change column order
    REVERSE() now works for complex scripts.
    !!! Choked: When getting words from SFM file.
        \ps \ge, \tx
    Selecting a LIFT writing system seems to work now.
    LIFT data without ref numbers seems to work now.
Spelling
    !!! Bug: Setting row complains when typing "15" because on receiving "1",
        it throws up a message box complaining it's not high enough.
    !!! Glitch: In Step Through List, some words are really small in Tamil,
        too small to see the difference between initial A and AA.
        However some are just fine.  Does the font size change from row to row?
        Still a problem in 1.9.9.5b even after resizing fields -- didn't make
        any difference.
    !!! Bug: Button to set correction should be disabled after pressing it.
    !!! Glitch: &DlgChangeMaker.HelpText appearing on dialog mouse hover.
    !!! TODO: Change date to April 2013 for generated files.
    !!! Bug: Saving as XSLT choked:
        //node2="5"
        /home/jkornelsen/Desktop/1.xsl
        Perhaps it's because of the new checkbox.
    Step Through List correctly starts at row 2 for new lists (including a
    second or third generated list), and otherwise picks up where it left off.
    Test simple CC table again.
    Run full CC table on an SFM file.
    Test XSLT file
    TODO: Find a built-in XSLT 1.0 processor on windows if possible.
Make spelling changes
    Tested applying list of corrections by SFM marker.
    !!! Choked: When making spelling corrections by language.
    !!! Problem: Making corrections by quotation char style didn't find
        anything. However emphasis char style worked.
        The same problem occurs with Data Conversion.
        Works: Definition, Drop Caps, Example, Index Link, Page Number, 
            Placeholder, Rubies, Source Text, Strong Emphasis, Teletype,
            Variable
        Doesn't work: Caption Characters, Endnote Characters, Footnote Anchor,
            Line Numbering, Internet Link, Main Index Entry
        Perhaps a naming problem - display versus underlying name?
    !!! Question: Making corrections (by para style) seems to match partial
        words. Is that what's expected?
        Then it seems like there's no point to punctuation, at least not for
        making corrections (it would still be useful for spell checking).
    !!! Bug: Affixes should be greyed out for corrections, but it does not
        get greyed out until corrections is reselected.
    Making corrections by font and para style seemed to work.
    Complex and asian fonts seemed to work.
    Spell check seemed to work pretty well.
    !!! Problem: Hyphenated words are inserted as a single word in the word
        list, yet spell check looks at each word separately.
        This seems inconsistent, and makes it not realize that the word has
        been considered correct.

Script Practice
    Word List Dialog correctly says "Get Words" now; never "Make List".
    Using a Tamil text as a word source seems to work.
