Phonology
    Lift
    !!! Bug: Updating chokes. (Even though finding seems to work fine).
    !!! Limitation: Writing system is only for phonetic / phonemic, not gloss.
        For example Moreira:22 gloss has both "en" and "pt" writing systems.
    JPDN37.6, JPDN38.7, JPDN38.8
    JGDN02.3, JGDN02.4
    0001, 0002
Grammar
    !!! Bug: Updated a lot of examples but then at the end said did not
        find an existing example to update.
        (Probably last one failed, but the error message doesn't make sense).
Abbreviations
    Scan
    Search
Data Conversion
    Ask before making each change.
    Default Para style.
Word list
    Apply Converters.
Spelling
    IsCorrect checkbox is working better now.
    !!! Improvement: Should change extension when radio buttons are changed,
        not later.
    !!! Make Change File chokes.

    Test simple CC table again.         # may be easier on Windows
    Run full CC table on an SFM file.   # may be easier on Windows
    TODO: Find a built-in XSLT 1.0 processor on windows if possible.
Make spelling changes
    !!! Bug: Changing para style Interlin Gloss was doing well but then ended
        up in an infinite loop after "Yes to All".
        Apparently same problem with spell checking.
    !!! Improvement: Keeping Calc settings in Writer is annoying because I
        save the Calc file but then the settings do not get saved. It is often
        confusing in various situations.
Script Practice
    Bad number of words is being corrected better now.
    Tested reset and not leaving spaces.
