Phonology
    Lift
    Find and Replace
    JGDN02.3, JGDN02.4
    JGDN02.5, JGDN03.5  # not found
    0001, 0002
    !!! Warning: Getting a second phonology file does not automatically clear
        the writing system field, which leaves it to something that might not
        be right.
        # Decision: Ignore this problem. Setting it to blank might not be
        #           any better.
    !!! TODO: What about the new version of phonology assistant?
        # Decision: The test version of PA doesn't yet export a general
        #           XML format, so there's nothing really to test.
    !!! Problem: When replacing an example before another example,
        it ended by applying default style, which messed up the tabs on
        the last example. For example these two lines using PhoneticCorpus.xml:
        #JPDN37.6
        atali...  (JPDN38.7)
        The same problem occurs when updating one example before another;
        the example below loses its customized tabs.
        However Update All does not have this problem, since the example may
        get messed up but then it gets redone.
        # Decision: Need to fix this.
    Tested changing fields manually (ge instead of phm).
    Did not test PA experimental transcriptions.
    !!! Question: Phonology updating examples did not make a comparison doc,
        even though _ComparisonDoc says 1. Is this intentional?
        # Decision: This is a testing mistake. It didn't appear until running
        #           Grammar Settings. Phonology does not need a Comp Doc.
    !!! Numbering width variable appears but I think is used only in grammar.
        # Decision: Same as above; this is also from Grammar Settings.
    Tested JPG files.
    !!! TODO: check help file to see if it matches up with what we are seeing.
    !!! Confusing: Specifying updating at the top does not mean you cannot
        still insert examples at the bottom of the dialog.
        # Decision: Resize the box frame to include everything above.
Grammar
    Numbering width.
    Updating examples.
    !!! Question: When updating examples, is there not supposed to be a button
        that goes back to the main document?
        # Decision: The main document needs to be saved first. Should this be
        #           mentioned in the help file? Maybe it's fine as is.
    !!! Improvement: If making a comparsion document, then should highlight the
        differences using a string comparison algorithm.
        Have the highlighting color configurable.
        # Decision: Not needed for version 2.0
    !!! Improvement: Only create one comparison document for each writeup.
        Use HasSettings or a similar variable to do this.
        # Decision: Fix this. Creating so many windows is ugly.
    Tested prefixes.
    Tested large example: fromSelvi-all.xml COCO.001
    Tested all lines.
    Spacing problems seem to be fixed now.
    !!! Improvement: Offer suggestion by getting ref no. that is closest
        string distance to what was entered, not just the first one.
        But offer the first one as a suggestion too.
        # Decision: Not needed for version 2.0
    !!! Error: WrittenTamilTexts.xml.Hunt02 tables does not wrap well.
        Seems to be a Tamil script problem with mborth=kaliyana,
        which goes across two lines in frames.
        Turning off mborth makes it work.
        # Decision: Look into this.
    !!! TODO: Test the latest fieldworks and toolbox output formats.
        # Decision: Yes, test this.
    Large examples seem to be reasonably fast on this system.
Abbreviations
    Search
    !!! Error: Searching found a blank string and suggested it.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Problem: Search moved the viewcursor. Should return to its original
        location when finished.
        # Decision: Not sure if this is really the best behavior or not. In
        # some cases we may want to end up where the search left off, in order
        # to make a correction and then continue searching. Don't change for
        # now.
Data Conversion
    Creating styles
    How to change the font of a style without changing the style.
    Perhaps just set the new paragraph style the same as the old one?
    Yes, this works, and it makes sense pretty much.
    !!! Bug: In "change by style in table.odt", Font in dialog shows up as
        &82.DlgDataConversion.cmbxScopeFont.Text
        Likewise for target para style.
        And char style in another .odt file.
        # Decision: This was must have been saved in the document due to using
        #           older versions of OOoLT. No need to fix.
Word list
    !!! Bug: Apply Converter is not defaulting to changed columns.
        1. Open new writer doc.
        2. Word List, move Word column down 1 (to B)
        3. Make empty list
        4. Open Apply Converter dialog. (Should be fine).
        5. Close spreadsheet.
        6. Word List, move Word column up 1 (back to A)
        7. Make empty list.
        8. Open Apply Converter dialog. Will still say B.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    Make a list from lots of different files
    Change column order
    Tested Apply Converter with three different encoding types.
    !!! Bug: Apply Converter is not defaulting to Skip first row (heading).
        Perhaps when first opened, or perhaps after a second word list is
        made from the same base document.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Limitation: REVERSE() does not work for complex scripts.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Irritating: If there is only one file in the list, then it should be
        selected / used by default when changing settings.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Limitation: (but this may already be documented in the help file):
        Getting words from "Whole Document" does not read contents in frames.
        # Decision: Not needed for version 2.0
    !!! Problem: Punctuation contains "[" but "NP[subj" is treated as a single
        word. Should split on punctuation.
        In that case I suppose "-" should not be considered punctuation.
        Well, maybe it is better as is.
        # Decision: Leave as is for version 2.0
    !!! Limitation: Punctuation \u201c and \u201d not in list by default.
        # Decision: Add this.
    !!! Error: Getting words from SFM files does not seem to work.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Limitation: A word ending in \u200c becomes an empty string in a word
        list. Now OOo does not render such words properly; however the data
        should probably not be lost.  For example "కామ్క్‌" in SpellingStatus.
        # Decision: Don't worry about this for version 2.0
    !!! Bug: Selecting a writing system did not stay when going back to change
        settings. It might not have had any effect at all actually.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Bug: Harvesting from .lift files seems to require a ref. no, which is
        probably not going to be common.
        # Decision: Fix this if it's not too difficult.
Spelling
    !!! Improvement: In Spelling Char Comp, have all boxes checked by default.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Improvement: In Step Through List, keep same row we left off in, until
        a new word list is generated.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Improvement: In Step Through List, move view to that row, in order to
        see occurrences for example.
        # Decision: Not needed for version 2.0
        # More Info: Check out UNO setFirstVisibleRow.
    !!! Improvement: In Step Through List, some words are really small in Tamil,
        too small to see the difference between initial A and AA.
        However some are just fine.  Does the font size change from row to row?
        # Decision: Look into this.
    !!! Improvement: In Step Through List, have a field that shows the number
        of occurrences of the selected similar word, as well as the number of
        occurrences of the current word.
        This will be a fairly complex change.
        # Decision: Not needed for version 2.0
    !!! Improvement: (fairly important, also easy): Do not allow setting a
        correction if the new is the same as the old.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Error: Full CC table splits up markers by individual character,
        that is, "\ " "l" "x" instead of "\lx".
        # Decision: Fix this.
    Check for glides
    Step through list
    Test simple CC table again.
    Run full CC table on an SFM file.
    Test XSLT file
    !!! Improvement: XSLT file should require only 1.0
    !!! Error: XSLT file look4changes should say "name", not "match"
    !!! Error: XSLT file look4changes should say "node()", not "self"
        # Decision: Fix all three of these.
    !!! Improvement: Make look4changes handle partial strings.
        Should we require punctuation breaks too?
        But often in XML data it is already broken by punctuation.
        Actually we probably want an option whether to match partial
        phrases or not.
        But if we do match partial phrases, then we will want a way to
        match word boundaries and punctuation.
        Probably leave this for a future version, and for now just match
        full tag contents.
        That should work for most fieldworks data, although not Toolbox
        (but that uses SFM).
        It will not handle free translations.
        # Decision: Try this.
    TODO: Find a built-in XSLT 1.0 processor on windows if possible.
Make spelling changes
    !!! Error: Spelling Search Options dialog radio buttons do not work right;
        cannot select both SFM and Apply Corrections.
        It also fails without an error message, perhaps due to the radio
        buttons not being selected right but who knows.
        # Decision: Fix this.
    Apply list of corrections
    Spell check
    Search language
    Search paragraph style
    Punctuation
Script Practice
    !!! Bug: When returning from adding an input file for script practice the
        first time, it said "Make List" instead of "Get Words"
        - Changing settings shows "Get Words"
        # Decision: Fix this.
    !!! Improvement: Make practice fields a little wider, in case we want to
        practice longer sentences.
        # Decision: Do this.
    !!! Improvement: Allow generating more than 9 words.
        # Decision: Do this.
    Use word list
    Tamil
Spanish
    Default Style
    Try for various error messages
French
    Default Style
    Try for various error messages
Automated Tests
Button driven Tests

2013-04-09 problems:
    !!! WrittenTamilTexts.hunt02 and hunt03 data are not correctly separated.
        Probably this is a data problem.
        But this seemed to work better during testing yesterday.
        Does it fix the problem to check all of the settings boxes?
    !!! Comparsion doc buttons do not seem to go to the examples, although they
        do go to the document.
