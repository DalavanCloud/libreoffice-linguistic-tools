[10:40:30 AM] SamSony: Sorry for delay
[10:41:04 AM] SamSony: Hi
[10:41:04 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: No problem.
[10:41:41 AM] SamSony: I am going to open Open office writer now
[10:41:50 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok
[10:42:18 AM] SamSony: I acn see writeups menu
[10:42:22 AM] SamSony: can*
[10:42:50 AM] SamSony: i clicked settings-Phonology
[10:43:23 AM] SamSony: browsing for xml
[10:43:43 AM] SamSony: but is exported xml is like...*paxml file
[10:44:03 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Does the "Settings for Phonology examples" dialog box come up?
[10:45:43 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Yes, that's right, it should end in .paxml
[10:46:06 AM] SamSony: ok
[10:48:28 AM] SamSony: i selected '*.paxml' file, but i can't see anything
[10:49:35 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: You should select the .paxml file and then press Open.  Then the path to the .paxml file should show up next to the Browse... button.  Is that right?
[10:49:51 AM] SamSony: yes...
[10:50:11 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, then click the "OK" button to close the settings.
[10:50:24 AM] SamSony: ok
[10:50:42 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Now go to Writeups menu -> Get Phonology examples
[10:50:49 AM] SamSony: ok
[10:51:13 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Next to the "Insert this example" button, type in an example number.
[10:52:01 AM] SamSony: in Oo writer?
[10:52:47 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Yes.  When you go to the menu option "Get phonology examples," a dialog box should come up, which says "Get phonology examples" at the top.  Did the dialog box come up?
[10:54:58 AM] SamSony: Jim,i type '1234' in the dialog box of Get Phonology Examples and click on Insert This Example button..ok?
[10:57:23 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, as long as there is an example 1234 in your data.
[10:58:27 AM] SamSony: ok
[10:59:10 AM] SamSony: yes i got example in Oo writer
[10:59:42 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok.  Does it look good?
[11:00:14 AM] SamSony: yes...with /  /   [  ]   gloss     ref no
[11:03:00 AM] SamSony: so we can insert one example  at one time?
[11:04:21 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: That is one way to do it.  Another way is to type all of the example numbers in the document, for example #1234 and #2345.  Then use the "Find Next Reference" and "Replace with Example" buttons
[11:04:39 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:06:19 AM] SamSony: eg: #0012 #0014 #0025 format?
[11:06:30 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Yes.
[11:06:35 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Or...
[11:06:42 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: #0012
[11:06:45 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: #0014
[11:06:56 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: #0025
[11:07:36 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:08:21 AM] SamSony: in 'dialog box ' Get Phonology Examples'?
[11:09:07 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: No, in the Writer document.  In the dialog box, it is currently only possible to insert one example at a time.  Would it be helpful to insert more than one example?
[11:09:19 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:13:26 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Would it be helpful to insert more than one example at a time using the "Insert this example" button?
[11:13:40 AM] SamSony: i have typed the ref nos in writer,and clicked on Find Next Reference
[11:13:48 AM] SamSony: but I can't see it
[11:14:38 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Try checking the box "Search from beginning of document"
[11:15:19 AM] SamSony: yes..i checked it
[11:15:45 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, then when you click "Find Next Reference," it should select a ref no.
[11:16:15 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:16:32 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Then press the "Replace with Example" button.
[11:16:43 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:17:19 AM] SamSony: but i didn't come it in writer
[11:17:37 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Did you type #1234 as the reference number?
[11:17:57 AM] SamSony: no...#0020
[11:19:07 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Oh, that is a different type of number from what I expected.  I will need to make a change so that it can find that type of number.  My example numbers look like #JPDN23.1
[11:20:02 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:20:16 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: #1234 won't work either, except with the "Insert this example" button.  But it should be easy for me to fix that.
[11:20:30 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:21:20 AM] SamSony: ref no style is 4 digit like 0001,0002.....0112
[11:21:29 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok.  No letters?
[11:21:36 AM] SamSony: no letter
[11:23:19 AM] SamSony: I think you want to make modification now or later?
[11:24:24 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Maybe sometime later today.  It will take me about 1/2 hour to make changes.
[11:24:49 AM] SamSony: ok
[11:25:01 AM] SamSony: Thank you very much for your work..
[11:25:07 AM] SamSony: May I go now?
[11:25:25 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Yes, we can talk later.
[11:25:35 AM] SamSony: bye now
[11:25:41 AM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Bye.
