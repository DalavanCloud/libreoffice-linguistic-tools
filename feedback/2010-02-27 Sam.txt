[2/26/2010 7:43:30 PM] SamSony: check*
[2/26/2010 7:52:58 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Hello Sam, I just arrived.
[3:31:22 PM] SamSony: Hi Jim
[3:31:39 PM] SamSony: you arrived in India?
[3:32:07 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Not yet.  We return to India at the end of next week.
[3:32:56 PM] SamSony: today evening I 'll work on Grammar writeup wusing OO tool
[3:33:23 PM] SamSony: now they are focusing on Grammar analysis
[3:33:47 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Have you tried to install the new .oxt file yet?
[3:34:06 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: LinguisticTools.oxt
[3:35:17 PM] SamSony: I have installed it,but I dont check it teams' Grammar write up..today evening I can do it
[3:36:09 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok.  Any problems when installing?  Did you see if there is now a "Linguistics" menu instead of the old "Writeups" menu?
[3:37:53 PM] SamSony: I can see it on menu
[3:38:11 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, it sounds like it installed correctly.
[3:38:22 PM] SamSony: I can see data conversion tool
[3:39:08 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok.  Can you do one thing: Go to Linguistics -> Data Conversion.  Then click the "Select converter" button, and see what happens.
[3:40:33 PM] SamSony: i tried to select it...but i couldn't select it
[3:41:21 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Did anything happen when you clicked "Select converter"?
[3:43:20 PM] SamSony: first time, I clicked on data conversion,then the message like  " uni.exe" has problem
[3:43:55 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Oh, I see.  There are two ways to fix that problem:
[3:44:02 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: 1. Close OpenOffice and then open it again.
[3:44:04 PM] SamSony: ok
[3:44:05 PM | Edited 3:44:17 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: 2. Reboot (if #1 didn't work).
[3:44:14 PM] SamSony: ok
[3:45:02 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: After that it should work ok.  If you reboot and it still says the uno.exe problem, then something is wrong.
[3:45:28 PM] SamSony: may i reboot now?
[3:45:40 PM] SamSony: reboot the system?
[3:46:03 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Well, first just try to close OpenOffice (all windows) and then open it again.  That might fix the problem.
[3:54:48 PM] SamSony: i rebooted the system...
[3:55:10 PM] SamSony: now i can select converter
[3:55:25 PM] SamSony: it is working!!
[3:56:36 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, good!  It shouldn't say the uno.exe problem any more until the next time you install a new version of LinguisticTools.oxt
[3:57:08 PM] SamSony: ok...what is uno.exe?
[3:57:57 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: It is part of OpenOffice.  It can run C++ code, which I need in order to call Bob Eaton's SIL Converters.
[3:58:16 PM] SamSony: ok...
[3:59:07 PM] SamSony: today evening i'll work on Grammar sketch...you'll be here then?
[3:59:19 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Yes, that would be fine.
[3:59:33 PM] SamSony: thank you
[4:00:19 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: Ok, bye.
[4:00:34 PM] SamSony: i think this is a great turning point
