[9:34:08 PM] SamSony: Phonology workshop over
[9:35:04 PM] SamSony: One of the team used FLEx-PA-Openoffice
[9:35:22 PM] SamSony: your tools helped them
[9:37:20 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: That sounds good.  Were there any problems or questions?
[9:42:09 PM] SamSony: we are facing one problem in OO,that is no data conversion in OO
[9:42:39 PM] SamSony: Grammar writeup we need dataconversion from Dev to Roman
[9:42:53 PM] SamSony: we have Teckit map
[9:44:12 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: I have been trying to get the data conversion macros to work in OOo.  Unfortunately there was a problem calling SIL Converters.  However I think I have found a solution now.  Hopefully in a few days it will be working.  Perhaps by Friday I can send it out.
[9:45:10 PM] SamSony: Thank you...looking forward to it...
[9:47:09 PM] Jim and Karen Kornelsen: I think because of the data conversion macro it should be named "Linguistic Tools" instead of "Writeup Tools," and the menu should be changed to say "Linguistics."  Does that sound ok?
[9:47:55 PM] SamSony: yea...that is ok
